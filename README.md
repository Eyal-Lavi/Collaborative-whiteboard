# Collaborative whiteboard

I created a drawing board,
Without client side development technology but only using clean js
that you can draw and work on the same drawing with friends live
You can also draw alone without cooperative mode and save the drawings for the next time we want to draw and continue from the same point where we stopped.

## Client side technologies
- Js
- Html
- Css
## Server-side technologies
- Node.js

## means of communication between users
-Socket
